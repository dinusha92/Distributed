First run the bootsrap server.

Then start running NodeHandler depending on the number of nodes you wanted on the network
NodeHandler automatically generates his port.

Then a menu will be appeared asking whether to search or a leave the network.

Option 1 would search the movie and return the address of the holder.
Option 2 would leave the network by unregistering from the bootstrap.
